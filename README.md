# Day 6

🎯 Day 6 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧩 Excel – Highlighting Insights with Conditional Formatting

Today I focused on one of the most powerful yet underused features in Excel: Conditional Formatting. I used a football player dataset to surface patterns, performance peaks, and anomalies — instantly making the data more readable and actionable.

✅ What I accomplished:

 - 📊 Applied Data Bars to the Assists column to visualize contribution at a glance

 - ⭐ Used Icon Sets to flag trends

 - 🔗 Combined Data Bars + Icons for an enhanced visual impact

 - 🧠 Created a custom formula rule to highlight players

 - 🔄 Added filters for dynamic exploration by team and position
   

🧪 It was a fun exercise in turning raw stats into visual stories — all without a single chart!

🕒 As with all these projects, I kept it within the 1 hour window — focusing on insight and clarity over polish.
